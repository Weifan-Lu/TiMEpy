# TidalStrain.2

TidalStrain.2 is a tool for calculating the theoretical tidal response. Originally developed by Dr. Fuyuki Hirose, this software is associated with research into the tidal forcing of interplate earthquakes.

## Download
The original TidalStrain.2 package is available for download from Dr. Fuyuki Hirose's website:

TidalStrain.2 may have compatibility issues on different systems. To address this, I have provided modified compilation files for reference.
